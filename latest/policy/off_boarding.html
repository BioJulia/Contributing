Reduced activity during a period of 2 months does not constitute inactivity.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="The-off-boarding-process-1" href="#The-off-boarding-process-1">The off-boarding process</a></h2><p>The off-boarding process of a member begins when either:</p><ol><li><p>A maintainer opts to off-board.</p></li><li><p>When an inactive member is brought to the attention of admin maintainers.</p></li><li><p>Any maintainer consistently breaks community code of conduct, or any other BioJulia guidelines.</p></li></ol><p>The process proceeds as follows.</p><ol><li><p>The admin open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/BioJulia/Community-Issues">BioJulia/Community-Issues</a>.</p><ol><li><p>It it titled &quot;Off-boarding notice: [NAME OF MAINTAINER]&quot;.</p></li><li><p>It has a label &quot;off-boarding&quot; attached.</p></li><li><p>It should also state this off-boarding notice will be displayed without furthur action for a month.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The admin must also send an email to the maintainer in question notifying them that an off-boarding notice has been posted. This email should explain the reason for the off-boarding notice: Whether it is because of inactivity, or due to breaches of code of conduct.</p></li><li><p>As per guidance in step 1.4, the notice is open for a period of 1 month without subsequent action.</p><ol><li><p>During this time, the maintainer may reply and point out if they have actually been active, and if so where. They may also put forward a case if they feel they have not broken code of conduct.</p></li><li><p>They may also contact an admin privately if their absence has been due to personal circumstances. In this case the admin must be sympathetic, and helpful to the individual, and must treat anything they are told as confidential. The admin must discuss with the individual what they want to happen, and how they (the admin) can help.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>After a month, if nothing is heard from the inactive maintainer:</p><ol><li><p>They are removed from the maintainer&#39;s group.</p></li><li><p>Admin or write access to repositories they maintained</p></li><li><p>They are placed into the Member&#39;s group.</p></li><li><p>They are added to the Alumni group in recognition of their time spent as a maintainer.</p></li><li><p>Their role description will be changed on their member profile at <a href="http://biojulia.net">biojulia.net</a></p></li></ol></li></ol><p>There are two situations in which off-boarding can be applied immediately:</p><ol><li><p>A member voluntarily requests off-boarding for themselves. In which case step 1 still occurs, with the exception that a move to step 4 immediately occurs without the notification period.</p></li><li><p>If a member with a degree of responsibility and administrative privileges is the offender, they may be off-boarded immediately, without the required notification period. This is to prevent the offending individual from abusing their position and retaliating against anyone they think made a report. When a conduct breach incident is resolved, if the accused is to remain a BioJulia member, then the precautionary off-boarding can be reversed. If the consequence of a conduct breach is expulsion from BioJulia, then of course the off-boarding will not be reversed.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The most important point:</strong> _It is to be understood, off-boarding as a result of inactivity, does not constitute a rejection of the member from the group, and that off-boarding is completely reversible. We all have busy periods in our lives. A member may join, contribute, become inactive for a long period of time, before getting more time and holding their old maintainer position again - they are always welcome. Off-boarding is only in place in order to prevent unnessecery levels of permissions which could pose a security risk._</p><footer><hr/><a class="previous" href="pull_requests.html"><span class="direction">Previous</span><span class="title">Pull Requests</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
