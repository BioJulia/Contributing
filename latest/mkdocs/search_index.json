Documentation regarding specific implementation details that aren't relevant    to users should be in the form of comments.        Documentation may be omitted if the function is not exported    (i.e. only used internally) and is short and obvious. E.g. \ncube(x) = x^3\n.        However, please consider that what may be obvious to you as the write of the    code, may not be obvious to others. Therefore, we do recommend documenting     as much as possible, to help out fellow julia coders and biologists    when they are reading and understanding the code. We are trying to    make BioJulia packages as easy as possible to use, understand, and code    on for everyone :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to documenting code in the source files through docstrings,    we encourage contributers to create documentation which is more akin to    a manual, complete with comprehensive explanations and examples of how     to use the package.        We use Documenter.jl and mkdocs, to generate such documentation    and host it on the web.    The source markdown files for such manuals are kept in the \ndocs/src/man\n    folder of each BioJulia package/repository.    \n\n\n\n\nAll significant code must be tested.    Tests should be organized into contexts, and into separate files based on     module.    Files for tests for a module go into an appropriately named    folder, within the \ntest\n folder in the Bio.jl git repo. E.g. tests    for the Seq module of Bio.jl go in the \ntest/seq\n folder of the Bio.jl     package.    \n\n\nAll code contributed should be compatible with the latest stable version of     Julia.    \n\n\nIf your contribution to a BioJulia package introduces a method which is    shared among submodules, they should be declared in the top level module,    and then extended by the submodules. For example, in Bio.jl, the method    \nseqname\n was defined in \nBio.Seq\n and overloaded by \nBio.Intervals\n     and \nBio.Align\n. Therefore the declaration of the method was moved to \nBio\n,    and the three submodules extend the declared method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle requirements for code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code files should have the following style of header:   \n# Title   # =====   #   # Short description.   #   # [Long description (optional)]   #   # This file is a part of BioJulia. License is MIT: \nlink to the license file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndent with 4 spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen returning values from a function, use an explicit \nreturn\n statement. Be aware that functions in julia return the   the result of the last statement in the function. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nType names are camel case, with the first letter capitalized. E.g. \nSomeVeryUsefulType\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule names are also camel case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction names, apart from constructors, are all lowercase.   Include underscores between words only if the name would be hard    to read without.   E.g.  \nstart\n, \nstop\n, \nfindletter\n \nfind_last_digit\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally try to keep lines below 80-columns, unless splitting a long line   onto multiple lines makes it harder to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles that declare modules should only declare the module, and import any   modules that it requires. Any code should be included from separate files.   E.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodule\n \nAwesomeFeatures\n\n\n\nusing\n \nIntervalsTrees\n,\n \nJSON\n\n\n\ninclude\n(\nfeature1.jl\n)\n\n\ninclude\n(\nfeature2.jl\n)\n\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles that declare modules should have the same name name of the module.   E.g the module \nSomeModule\n is declared under the file \nSomeModule.jl\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparate logical blocks of code with one blank line,   or two blank lines for function/type definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen extending method definitions, define the methods with a module name prefix. E.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nBase\n.\nstart\n(\niter\n::\nYourType\n)\n\n  \n...\n\n\nend\n\n\n\nBase\n.\ndone\n(\niter\n::\nYourType\n,\n \nstate\n)\n \n=\n \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument functions using bare docstrings before a definition:\n\n\n\n\nThis function foo\ns something\n\n\nfoo\n(\nx\n)\n \n=\n \n2\n*\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions that get or set variables in a type should not be   prefixed with 'get' or 'set'.   The getter should be named for the variable it sets, and the setter   should have the same name as the getter, with the suffix \n!\n.   For example, for the variable \nnames\n:\n\n\n\n\nname\n(\nnode\n)\n \n# get node name\n\n\nname!\n(\nnode\n,\n \nsomename\n)\n \n# set node name",
